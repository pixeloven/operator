# fm-secondmate-liveness-lib.sh - shared persistent-secondmate endpoint liveness
# probing and recovery. bin/fm-bootstrap.sh owns the session-start sweep and
# bin/fm-watch.sh owns the ordinary-supervision poll tick; both drive this
# library so classification handling and the guarded relaunch path stay
# single-sourced here.
#
# A secondmate's recorded endpoint is the tmux window, herdr pane, hc terminal,
# T3 thread, or remote peer it runs in. Probing classifies that endpoint through the owning
# backend adapter's fm_backend_agent_state (local) or the remote control script's
# state verb (remote), which returns one of:
#
#   alive       - a primary-agent runtime is positively running
#   dead        - no agent remains in a pane, or T3 reports a failed run
#   missing     - the endpoint itself is gone
#   ambiguous   - backend inventory could not prove either way
#   unreadable  - backend state exists but could not be parsed
#   unverified  - the endpoint is recorded under a session this home does not
#                 own, so probing is not authorized
#
# Only `dead` and `missing` authorize recovery. The probe and recovery functions
# below own whether that means resuming the endpoint or proving its close before
# replacement; docs/t3code-backend.md owns T3's native status meanings.
# `ambiguous`, `unreadable`, and `unverified` leave the endpoint untouched -
# relaunching on inconclusive evidence could create a second endpoint beside a
# live one - and an unreachable remote host is never evidence of death, so a
# remote route is never replaced by a local endpoint.
#
# Replacement relaunch goes through `bin/fm-spawn.sh <id> --secondmate` with
# FM_SPAWN_NO_GUARD=1, the same guarded path every recovery uses. A local mate
# is pinned to its recorded backend. That path re-resolves placement from the
# task's own metadata and registry route, so a
# remote mate is relaunched on its recorded remote host through bin/fm-on.sh -
# never as a local replacement - behind fm-spawn's own readiness gate and
# per-task spawn lock.
#
# Modes:
#   full - session-start sweep: remote routes run the full readiness repair
#          sequence before probing, and an alive remote route is revalidated
#          (route readable, backend matches the recorded one) so the sweep
#          reports drift.
#   poll - watcher tick: remote routes take one read-only state probe per
#          check; repair still happens, but inside fm-spawn's launch gate only
#          when a relaunch is actually authorized.
#
# Concurrency: fm_secondmate_liveness_lock serializes probe+kill+relaunch per
# task across the bootstrap sweep, the watcher tick, and bin/fm-control.sh's
# secondmate relaunch (which holds it from before the old agent stops until the
# replacement is confirmed), so a concurrent relaunch can never be observed
# mid-flight as a dead endpoint and killed.
# The kill itself is additionally guarded by fm-spawn's per-task spawn lock: a
# relaunch never kills an endpoint while any spawn of that task is in flight,
# including a hand-run `fm-spawn.sh <id> --secondmate` that holds no liveness
# lock, and it re-reads the endpoint under that lock so a replacement published
# since the probe is never mistaken for the dead one.
# A separate per-home lock serializes relaunches of different mates, since each
# fresh spawn owns the same task-set lock. The watcher uses its spawn timeout
# as the lock-wait bound; an untimed sweep defaults to 600 seconds.
# The attempt ledger (.secondmate-relaunch-<id>, one line per attempt plus one
# per outcome) is both the durable relaunch record and the input to the
# watcher's relaunch bound; teardown removes it.

# Acts on a `relaunchable` probe verdict for <id>: takes the per-home relaunch
# lock, records the attempt, kills a confirmed-dead local endpoint if required
# (FM_SM_LIVE_KILL), runs the guarded spawn, then records its outcome.
# On t3code a close that cannot be proven stops there: the thread and its
# metadata stay as recorded, the verdict becomes skipped, and nothing is
# spawned, because a second thread beside a live one is the duplicate
# supervisor recovery must never create. Other backends keep their existing
# best-effort kill. FM_SM_LIVE_RESUME instead sends the endpoint's backend
# resume turn and spawns nothing.
# The header owns the lock-wait bounds. A positive timeout separately
# wraps the spawn in fm_run_timed so a watcher poll stays bounded; 124/137 mean
# the bound fired. Returns the spawn exit status; combined spawn output is in
# FM_SM_LIVE_OUT and the status in FM_SM_LIVE_RC. When the lock wait expires,
# the ledger cannot be read, a kill is due while a spawn of <id> holds its spawn
# lock or the endpoint now reads something other than dead or unreadable, or
# the attempt row cannot be appended, nothing is killed or spawned and no
# attempt is recorded: the verdict becomes FM_SM_LIVE_STATUS=skipped with
# FM_SM_LIVE_REASON set and this returns 1. A kill due on an endpoint that now
# reads unreadable likewise kills and spawns nothing, but records the attempt
# as failed and is reported rather than deferred.
# FM_SM_LIVE_DEFERRED=1 marks the two skips that are not faults - a spawn in
# flight, or an endpoint that now reads something other than dead or
